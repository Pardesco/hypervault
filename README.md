# Hypervault

A 3D **Code City** dashboard for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) — visualize your projects as a living cyberpunk cityscape.

Each project in your vault becomes a building. Status maps to color, priority to height, category to district. A central **Neural Core** pulses with activity as you work, and **Data Arteries** flow from the core to buildings when files change.

## Features

### City Visualization
- **Bin-packed layout** with category districts, block outlines, and drag handles for rearranging
- **Procedural architecture** — each category gets a unique silhouette (helix towers, data shards, ziggurats, quant blades, hex hives, memory cores)
- **Cyberpunk shader system** with procedural windows, decay dithering, and bloom post-processing
- **Smart labels** with CSS2D rendering and leader lines
- **Hover tooltips** showing status, priority, health, and tech stack

### Interactions
- **Click** a building to open its note
- **Right-click** a building for context menu (Launch Claude, Open in Explorer, Open Note, Focus Camera)
- **Right-click** the Neural Core orb to launch Claude Code in any folder via OS folder picker
- **Double-click** a building to enter move mode (reposition individual buildings)
- **Drag handles** to rearrange entire category blocks
- **Scroll** to zoom, **right-drag** to pan
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: cycle blocked/stale projects, reset camera

### Neural Core & Data Arteries
- Central **geodesic wireframe sphere** with RGB chromatic split and rotating rings
- **Data Arteries** — animated tube geometry flowing from core to buildings on file changes
- **City states**: IDLE (cyan) / STREAMING (cyan fast) / BULK_UPDATE (gold)

### Claude Code Integration
- **Activity Monitor** polls `.hypervault-status.json` for real-time Claude Code status
- **Persistent streaming artery** while Claude is actively working on a project
- **Activity indicator overlay** shows current project and action
- **Terminal Launcher** — right-click any building or the Neural Core to launch Claude Code
- **Heartbeat script** (`scripts/heartbeat.js`) for Claude Code hooks integration

### HUD
- **HYPERVAULT** neon title with flashing block cursor at top center
- **Legend panel** showing status colors and priority heights
- **Controls hint** overlay
- **Save Layout** button for persisting block positions

## Frontmatter Schema

Projects are detected by frontmatter tag `project` or field `type: project`. See [SCHEMA.md](SCHEMA.md) for the full field reference.

```yaml
---
tags: [project]
title: My Project
status: active
priority: high
category: web-apps
stack: [TypeScript, React, Vite]
projectDir: C:\path\to\project
---
```

## AI Integration

Hypervault has **no built-in AI**. External AI tools (Claude Code, etc.) read `SCHEMA.md` to learn the frontmatter format, scan your project directories, and write frontmatter to vault notes. Hypervault renders the result.

The `scripts/heartbeat.js` script can be wired into Claude Code hooks to enable real-time activity visualization:

```bash
node scripts/heartbeat.js --vault="/path/to/vault" --project="my-project" --action="editing"
```

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev    # watch mode
npm run build  # production build
```

Built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand), and the [Obsidian Plugin API](https://docs.obsidian.md/).
